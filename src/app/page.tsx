  {
    question: "Will using a hosted scanner slow down or impact my targets?",
    answer:
      "Our scanners are engineered to be efficient and respectful of your network's capacity. You have granular control over scan intensity and scheduling, ensuring you can run comprehensive security checks without causing performance degradation to live production assets.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get my data out of the platform?",

      "Yes. Every scan generates a machine-readable XML file and a presentation-ready PDF. You own your data and can export it to use in your own internal tools or spreadsheets.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can I get my first scan results?",
    answer:
      "Because our platform is hosted and requires zero local installation, you can configure your target and launch your first basic scan immediately after sign-up. Depending on the complexity of the target, you will typically see preliminary, actionable results within 5 to 30 minutes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where is my scanning data and report information stored?",

      "All scan data is stored securely in encrypted cloud storage (using AES-256 encryption) within our certified cloud region. We provide signed URLs for report access and robust access controls to ensure only authorized users on your team can view the reports.",
